Welcome! I intend to share here some interesting ideas, papers and updates in machine learning, statistics and mathematics. 

## Short Bio
I am presently working as a Data Scientist wherein I build and deploy machine learning based solutions to interesting problems. My work has centered around problems in online-advertising, marketing and operational forecasting. 
    Previously, I obtained a PhD in Mathematics. Specifically, I worked in Index theory(out of Atiyah-Singer Index theorem [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiyah%E2%80%93Singer_index_theorem)) which, briefly speaking, explores the interplay between analysis and topology. In addition, I have also worked in Riemannian geometry and smooth dynamical systems. 
    In general, I maintain a strong interest in problems involving rich geometry. In machine learning, its fascinating to see applications of geometric techniques in areas of Topological data analysis, Geometric deep learning(Graph Convolution Networks, manifold learning) and and Knowledge graphs.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kunalrsharma/kunalrsharma.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
